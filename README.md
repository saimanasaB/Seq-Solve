Job Sequencing Problem

This project tackles the Job Sequencing Problem, a classic optimization challenge in computer science and operations research. The objective is to maximize the profit by selecting a subset of jobs to execute within their respective deadlines. The application provides an intuitive interface using Streamlit, a popular framework for building interactive web applications with Python. Users can input details for multiple jobs, including their IDs, deadlines, and profits.

Behind the scenes, the application employs four different algorithms to solve the Job Sequencing Problem: Knapsack, Dynamic Programming, Max Heap, and Branch and Bound. Each algorithm offers a unique approach to optimizing job selection based on different criteria such as profit, deadline constraints, and computational efficiency. The choice of algorithm can significantly impact the solution's accuracy and computational speed, allowing users to explore various strategies and understand their trade-offs.

Furthermore, the application offers a comparative analysis feature, enabling users to compare the performance of different algorithms in terms of the maximum profit achieved. This functionality allows users to gain insights into how each algorithm performs under varying job configurations and problem instances. By providing both a practical solution to the Job Sequencing Problem and a tool for algorithmic exploration, this project serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals interested in combinatorial optimization and algorithm design.
